# Cambysses' Tampermonkey scripts
A collection of all my TM scripts.

## coindesk-value
Prints the value of your crypto holdings for a given coin below the price ticker on coindesk.com. I created this so I don't have to log into the app every time to get an idea of how much my coins are worth.

## latest-tweets.js
Automatically switches twitter to chronological tweets.

The sociopaths over at Twitter think they know better than you do, so even if you set your timeline to show "latest" instead of "top" tweets, they will automatically switch it back after some time. Nobody fucking wants this, so I wrote this sloppy script to automatically switch it back.

Tested and working in Chrome and Firefox as of May 2021.

## mirror-youtube-layout.js
Moves the recommended videos panel from the right to the left of the page layout.
