# LatestTweets
Greasemonkey script to automatically switch to "latest" tweets.

The sociopaths over at Twitter think they know better than you do, so even if you set your timeline to show "latest" instead of "top" tweets, they will automatically switch it back after some time. Nobody fucking wants this, so I wrote a sloppy Greasemonkey script to automatically switch it back.

This works in Firefox, have not tested with other browsers.
